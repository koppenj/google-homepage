My [version](https://koppenj.github.io/google-homepage/)

    Assuming this will be the first true eye opener for me. The Odin Project has tasked me with trying to mimick the Google homepage as an "easy project' in HTML/CSS. I plan on continuing to work on my terminal skills along with implementing GIT for version control. 
    At conclusion, I'd really like to be more confident in understnading the structure of HTML elements. Especially parent/child hiearchy. I'm finding syntax to be more accessible when I'm able to devote more time with a language. Cheers!

    Okay, after a few nights of picking at all the bits that have irritated me in my sleep, I'm ready to submit a pull request. Looking back, I'm glad that there are innumerable resources on the internet to guide me to my solution. Also, CSS Grid and flex are pretty neat. I think thats where my biggest hangup was in the beginning. Layout! I'm hoping to revisit this project in the future to nitpick details as I learn them. I think it would be a fun way to show progression at the basic level.
