    Assuming this will be the first true eye opener for me. The Odin Project has tasked me with trying to mimick the Google homepage as an "easy project' in HTML/CSS. I plan on continuing to work on my terminal skills along with implementing GIT for version control. 
    At conclusion, I'd really like to be more confident in understnading the structure of HTML elements. Especially parent/child hiearchy. I'm finding syntax to be more accessible when I'm able to devote more time with a language. Cheers!
